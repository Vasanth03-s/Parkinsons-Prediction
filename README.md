# Parkinson's Disease Prediction

A machine learning project to predict Parkinsonâ€™s disease using patient voice measurements.

## ðŸ§  Description

This notebook builds a model to detect Parkinsonâ€™s disease based on biomedical voice data. It involves data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation.

## ðŸ”§ Features

- Load and explore biomedical voice data  
- Train classification models (e.g., SVM, Logistic Regression)  
- Evaluate model accuracy and performance

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook

## ðŸš€ Run the Project

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn

# Open notebook
jupyter notebook "Parkinsons Prediction.ipynb"
